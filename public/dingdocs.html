                                    Welcome to the rebellious world of DingDash, a social media platform where you can breaks free from the chains of
                                    control and 24/7 monitoring. At DingDash you can be you, live your life, and never have to look over your shoulder.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    DingDash is a microblogging platform similar to others you may have seen, such as Facebook or Twitter, but instead
                                    of
                                    being centralised it is a federated network based on Mastodone which operates in a similar way to email.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This decentralisation allows us to connect to those that live in closed nations and it also helps keep your
                                    information
                                    safe. This means there’s no government access to your account, no no central control, no advertising, and no large
                                    corporations dictating what you can and cannot say.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Those other social media networks – yea they watch you get undressed, peek into your browsing files, and monitor you
                                    on
                                    the toilet. Not at DingDash. At DingDash, you are truly free! - So use the toilet again without being watched.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This tutorial will introduce you to the basic concepts and features of DingDash and will help you experience
                                    everything
                                    that social media promised you, but didn't deliver.
                                    This tutorial is not comprehensive and does not cover every single feature. It is a tutorial – not the Bible – that
                                    means you will learn some basic features, but to learn the rest, you will need to pray for it.

                        <p>DingDash started as a unique community primarily made up of persecuted Christians from around the world that do not want the government watching them, controlling their content, or filtering their messages. When you join DingDash, you will be able to connect with, pray for, and be inspired by persecuted Christians from around the world. </p>
                        <h4>What does the name DingDash Mean? </h4>

                        <p>DingDash is based on the vital messaging system made up of dings and dashes known as Morse Code. Morse Code proved to be detrimental to send messages between war ships in enemy waters during WWII. The logo for DingDash is JESUS spelled out in Morse Code. </p>

                                <p>If you would like to keep your Dings more private, there are several options for you to choose from before you
                                    publish your Ding. At the bottom of your test box you have a few small icons, one of which is a globe. </p>
                                <p> If you click on the globe, a box will drop down like the picture of the left with a few options. </p>
                                
                                <p> The four options that you have for security are pretty self-explanatory. For the least secure and most open, click
                                    Public. For the most secure and least open option, click Direct. This option refers to direct mail and will only be
                                    sent as a private message to those mentioned.
                                </p>

                                    These prayers hands are powerful so please use them responsibly.  With great power comes great responsibility.  Clicking here will BOOST the Ding and give it more traction so that others are more likely to see it.  The prayer hands are more than just an icon telling a fellow Dash'er that you are praying for their Ding, but it is a tangible way of doing something immediately – which is booting their post.  Do you like a post – THEN BOOST IT.  The more that a Ding is boosted, the more it is likely that others will see it.

For example you may read an encouraging quote you’d like to pass on through another social media that is not as cool or as Christian as DingDash (but hey – to each his own).  If you use other social media, I will not cast the first stone (but perhaps the second or third stone).

                                <p>We cannot express this enough!  Hashtag! </p>
                                <p>Hashtags are REALLY important when finding friends.  In fact, they are the only part of the Dings that are searchable.  So if you want to be found by people searching for sermons, it is best to include #sermons in your ding.  </p>

                                <p>Here is an example of a Ding from my account looking for friends in closed nations.  </p>

                                <h5>Home </h5>
                                <p>Home is where you go to see all of your Dings in chronological order as well as Dings of the people you’re following. </p>
                                
                                <h5>Notifications</h5>
                                <p>This one – well – kind of does what it says.  It's a place to see where you have been mentioned in other posts or actions have been taken in response to your Ding.  </p>

                                <p>This is where the magic happens.  Local is the live feed of all the Dings of people in your network or even from people who have hashtag'ed a specific topic. This is the town square and has a bit of a Slack chatroom to it.     </p>
                              
                                <h5>Federated</h5>
                                <p>Feeling adventurous and wanting to meet new people?  Time to get federated!  Here you can find the public Dings of those around the world that have not locked their accounts.  This column moves fast, and can often be pretty wild.  You might enjoy setting that column to show only Dings with media from China, dangerous selfies, funny memes, or funky art.</p>

                                <h5>Settings</h5>
                                <p>One of the best settings on DingDash is that button that says “CW” where you write your Dings. Clicking that button adds a Content Warning to your Ding.  Since this forum is primarily made up of Christians, if you post a disturbing Ding that could be offensive (eg. Violence, language, nudity, etc) you can just push this button and it will not automatically scroll across the feed of others that might want to avoid seeing that material. </p>
